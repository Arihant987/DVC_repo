1) make git repo and then clone it
2) create mycode.py and add code to it and store data in csv file
3) add and commit before initializing DVC
# pip install dvc
5) dvc init
6) dvc remote -d myremote s3{url} tell remote to dvc like remote origin of github dvc add remote -d myremote s3
7) dvc add data, do versioning error remove git and then do git add 2 files for tracking
8) dvc commit dvc push
9) Do a git add-commit-push to mark this stage as first version of data
10) Now add new row and check status using dvc status
11) dvc commit dvc push
12) git add--commit(second version)
13) repeat for third step

# Git will keep track of s3 but not data{gitignore} data have to be changed through dvc
# Due to git{checkout} mycode,s3 and data.dvc is changing and then md5 id dvc know something change so we do dvc pull which change data
# When dvc add-commit data.dvc is changed and 2 files add in cache and due to push s3 is changed
# Also in .dvc file in cache{gitignore} md5 id and data are added which are maintained constant throughout
